Our approach for aligning to the transcriptome was to stitch together all isoforms according to the genomic indices of their exons, and run the bowtie algorithm on each to see if a read aligned to any isoform with less than 6 mismatches. Since we don't have PHRED scores to properly implement the bowtie algorithm, we tried all possible indices for backtracking and making one intentional mismatch, then greedily assigned following mismatches. To align to unknown genes/exons, we went through all possible combinations of seeds of at least length 10, testing 1, 2, or 3 seeds since we knew that there were at max 2 introns spliced from within a read, and ran bowtie on the individual seeds. We then made sure the sum of the mismatches for all seeds was less than 6 for a valid alignment. We also checked that there was a valid combination of suffixes in the genome as returned by bowtie that had were separated in the genome by valid intron lengths before returning a valid alignment.
